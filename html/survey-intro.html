    <p id="survey-desc">This survey calculates a score based on carbon emissions produced from your daily habits.</br>
    </br>While it is not directly related to a carbon footprint, it is an informed score based on independent environmental research. This application serves as a proof of concept.</br>
    </br>Complete the survey by selecting the answers that best match your daily habits. There will be four sections in this survey: Transportation, Water, Home, and Diet. Once you have answered the questions in each section your carbon emissions score will be calculated and you will be able to set a goal for much you would like to reduce your carbon emission score by.</p>
